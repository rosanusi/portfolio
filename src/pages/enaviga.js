                    <span className="date">2017</span>
                    <p>Enaviga.com helps people rent boats easily while also helping boat owners manage their boats more effectively and on-the-go.</p>
                    <p>I worked on designing the user experience of the boat management web app for their partners. This was a freelance project that had a very close deadline. We had to improvise on the process to be able to launch this to the market</p>

            <div className="workImage">

                <h6 className="small-title">Introduction</h6>
            
                <p>The two co-founders - both boat owners - realized thereâ€™s a space in the market for an app that combines boat management, boat maintenance and boat rental. In this way, you are able to handle check-in and check-out of boats while also managing and maintaining their boat.</p>

<p>In the early stage, there was a market research carried out. We gathered that one major issue people have with current apps have is that the process of adding your boat to the inventory is tedious.</p>

<p>One major thing the first version aims to solve is to make sure it connects the management features to the online check-in feature of the customer-facing boat rental mobile app.</p>

            <div className="rdwn-work-copy">
                <h6 className="small-title">Information architecture</h6>
                <p>It made sense to map out the major categories, understand important information under each of them and how they seat among one another.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="workImage">
                    <Img fluid={props.data.imageTwo.childImageSharp.fluid} />
            </div>

            <div className="rdwn-work-copy">
                <p>I found figma to be great for some sort of card sorting exercises especially when your collaborators are remote. I did visual audit of different boat rental apps and documented the common categories found in their boat listing pages.  </p>
                <p>We used figma to collaborate on the information architecture. It helped us get alignment quite easily.</p>

            <div className="rdwn-work-copy">
                <h6 className="small-title">The wireframes</h6>
                <p>To remove confusion on some of the features, I designed some more user flows. This helped us to organize our discussions and helped us progress quite faster.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="workImage">
                <Img fluid={props.data.imageFour.childImageSharp.fluid} />

            <div className="rdwn-work-copy">
                <h6 className="small-title">The visual design</h6>
                <p>We opted for a very syimple and clear visual design with help tips that help people progress in the forms quite easily without help.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="workImage">
                <Img fluid={props.data.imageFive.childImageSharp.fluid} />
            </div>

            <div className="rdwn-work-copy">
                <span className="small-title">User testing on usertesting.com</span>
                <p>One of the challenges of designing for early stage companies is that research is usually not prioritized. To get around this, I conducted a remote unmoderated user test using Invision prototype on userstesting.com.

Based on the insights from the user testing, we iterated further on the designs and the development team implemented the designs.</p>
