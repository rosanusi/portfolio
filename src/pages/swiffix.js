                <p>With so many handymen around but difficult to identify trustable professionals among them. Swiffix's aim was to validate the hypothesis that, creating a rating based community of handymen will make it easier for people to identify the best professionals around town.</p>

                <p>In collaboration with a very small team - The founder, An engineer and a Marketing manager, we spent the following two months to create the MVP of the platform to validate the hypothesis at hand. My role was to design the first version of the iOS App. And based on that, lay the foundation of the web version.</p>

                <p>At the beginning, there were explorations around adding delight to the experience with introduction of colors and copy that's perceived as fun. As we move along during the validation phase, we did realized that a different approach where we bring the functionality of the product to the front works better. </p>

                <p>As we enter development phase of the iOS project, we started thinking about creating a web version of the product. Created the customer journey mirroring the experience present on the mobile version with the affordances that desktop allows.</p>
